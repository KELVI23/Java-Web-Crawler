The Amazon group of companies participates in E-Verify. E-Verify is a web-based system that allows an employer to determine an employee's eligibility to work in the US using information reported on an employee's Form I-9. The E-Verify system confirms eligibility with both the Social Security Administration (SSA) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). For more information, please go to the USCIS E-Verify website. We do not charge any fee for employment and the same applies to the Recruitment Partners who we work with. Amazon is an equal opportunity employer. Employment decisions are based on merit.  Additionally, we do not ask for any refundable security deposit to be paid in bank accounts for employment purposes. We request candidates to be cautious of misleading communications and not pay any fee/ deposit to individuals/ agencies/ employment portals on the pretext of attending Amazon interview process or seeking employment with us. These would be fraudulent in nature. Anyone dealing with such individuals/ agencies / employment portals will be doing so at his/her own risk and Amazon will not be held responsible for such loss or damage suffered directly or indirectly. Such fake job offers and appointment letters shall not be treated as any kind of offer or representation by Amazon. Please note, Amazon does not send offer letters from Hotmail, Yahoo, Gmail or any other public email accounts or demand a fee in lieu of an employment offer / interview. If you receive such e-mails, please do not pay any fee or deposit. We request that you report such offers to recruiting-feedback@amazon.com. If you have already made a payment, please log a complaint with the local police for necessary legal action to be taken. You may be restricted from having employment discussions with Amazon or its subsidiaries if you are currently participating, or previously participated, in government acquisition or other matters involving Amazon or its subsidiaries. To learn how the rules apply to your specific situation, please consult your employer’s ethics officer. You can view the equal employment opportunity poster at EEO is the Law or Supplement. Certain government employees who work on procurements for government contracts are required to file a written disqualification memorandum if the employee commences to seek employment.  According to the U.S. Federal Government rules, the employee is also required to provide written notice of employment contacts even if the employee or contractor rejects the possibility of employment.  Please consult your employer’s ethics officer for advice on your specific situation. You may not meet with employees of the government client to discuss the contract with which you were closely involved during your time with the government.  Please consult your employer’s ethics officer for advice on your specific situation. The U.S. Federal Government restrictions on seeking outside employment apply broadly to include contacting prospective employers about possible employment. This includes sending resumes to a prospective employer. Notice to current government employees: Certain laws and regulations place restrictions on employment discussions between government employees and non-government entities. Before proceeding further, please review the following FAQ’s pertaining to current government employment. By proceeding to engage in any employment discussions with Amazon.com and/or any of its subsidiaries, you are representing that you have confirmed with your employer or through other reasonable inquiry that you are permitted to engage in such discussions under the applicable laws and regulations. Please be cautious of common scams that offer unauthorized Amazon employment opportunities. Our recruiters who contact candidates — whether it be via text, call, or email—will never ask for banking information, or request an enrollment fee. We encourage those who think they may have been contacted by a fraudulent source offering a job on behalf of Amazon to report it via http://www.amazondelivers.jobs/contactus. We actively investigate reported employment scams, and as a result, dozens of fraudulent recruiting websites have been taken down. On May 25, Amazon’s shareholders approved a 20-for-1 split of our common stock. If you receive RSUs as part of your offer on or before June 3, 2022, the RSUs in the offer are in pre-split figures. By the time the RSUs are visible in your account, the split-adjusted amount will be reflected. If you receive an offer after June 3, 2022, the RSUs will be split-adjusted, meaning that the RSUs in your offer letter will match the total amount you will see in your Amazon stock account.

For questions about applying and interviewing at Amazon outside of Student Programs, please refer to the Amazon.jobs career site FAQs.
